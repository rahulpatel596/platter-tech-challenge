# Platter Technical Challenge
# Author: Rahul Patel

- Deployed using Github pages as it was a simple prototype with HTML, TailwindCSS, Javascript.


Additional Notes:
- TailwindCSS loaded using CDN, I understand which is not the optimal way to load it but as this is prototype. I did not want to add extra complexity with using any bundlers.
