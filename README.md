Additional Notes:
- TailwindCSS loaded using CDN, I understand which is not the optimal way to load it. In production, we would use better build setup along with bundlers(vite, webpack etc.) to reduce the size.
- Shopify version of the code might not be the most optimal code, there were some changes and tweaks I had to make to add shop-more feature for mobile device.
- There is also some repetitive code in Shopify version due to limitations in Liquid templating.
