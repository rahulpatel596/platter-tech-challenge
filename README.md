Additional Notes:

- TailwindCSS loaded using CDN, I understand which is not the optimal way to load it. In production, we would use better build setup along with bundlers(vite, webpack etc.) to reduce the size.
- I have added product images inside the codebase as we do not have large number of images. Not a good idea in real project as it would increase the size of the codebase. In production we would use some CDN or some external service. In case of shopify, we can use shopify images directly.
- Shopify version of the code might not be the most optimal code, there were some changes and tweaks I had to make to add shop-more feature for mobile device.
- There is also some repetitive code in Shopify version due to limitations in Liquid templating.
